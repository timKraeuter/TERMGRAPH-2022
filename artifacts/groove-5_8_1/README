[The GROOVE Tool Set](http://groove.sf.net)
=====================

Installation and use
--------------------

The bin subdirectory of the GROOVE directory (into which you unzipped the
downloaded archive) contains jar files for each of the toolkit programs:
e.g., Simulator.jar, Generator.jar. You can use these in either of the
following ways:

*  In a file manager window opened on the bin directory, double-click the jar file;

*  In a command line window, run `java -jar GROOVE_PATH/bin/Program.jar [parameters]`,
   where `GROOVE_PATH` is the groove directory and `Program` is the toolkit
   program in question. If you use `-h` as parameter, you will get information
   about the (other) command-line parameters.

See usermanual.pdf for instructions on how to use the GROOVE Tool Set
(including these installation instructions), or quick-reference.pdf for a quick
non-comprehensive overview.

Features
--------

Here is a brief list of the features supported by GROOVE. For details please
consult the included user manual or quick reference poster,
or the YouTube demos on [the GROOVE web site](http://groove.sf.net).

*  Visual editing and simulation of graphs and graph transformation rules
*  Global rule priorities or control program
*  State space exploration using customised exploration strategies
*  Model checking generated transition systems over CTL and LTL formulae
*  Regular expression matching and label wildcards in transformation rules
*  Primitive data types (int, string, bool and real) with corresponding operations
*  Nested (i.e., quantified) rules
*  Typing and inheritance through node types
*  Prolog querying of graphs and state space

Tools
-----

The installation includes the following tools:

*  `Simulator(.jar)`: a GUI-based tool that lets you construct, simulate and
   model check rule systems visually;
*  `Generator(.jar)`: a command line tool that lets you simulate and model check
   rule systems without the performance penalty of the GUI;
*  `ModelChecker(.jar)`: a command line tool for CTL model checking;
*  `PrologChecker(.jar)`: a command line tool for executing Prolog queries on an
   explored grammar;
*  `GroovyChecker(.jar)`: a command line tool for executing Groovy scripts on an
   explored grammar;
*  `Imager(.jar)`: a command line or GUI tool that supports conversions from
   GROOVE graphs and rules to other visual formats.
*  `Viewer(.jar)`: a stand-alone (GUI) viewer for \GROOVE graphs and rules.
